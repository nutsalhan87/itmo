/*
 *  4.1.2. State Machine Operation Overview
 *
 * When starting up, BBR probes to try to quickly build a model of the network
 * path; to adapt to later changes to the path or its traffic, BBR must
 * continue to probe to update its model. If the available bottleneck bandwidth
 * increases, BBR must send faster to discover this. Likewise, if the round-trip
 * propagation delay changes, this changes the BDP, and thus BBR must send slower
 * to get inflight below the new BDP in order to measure the new BBR.min_rtt.
 * Thus, BBR's state machine runs periodic, sequential experiments, sending faster
 * to check for BBR.bw increases or sending slower to yield bandwidth, drain the
 * queue, and check for BBR.min_rtt decreases. The frequency, magnitude, duration,
 * and structure of these experiments differ depending on what's already known
 * (startup or steady-state) and application sending behavior (intermittent or
 * continuous).
 * This state machine has several goals:
 *
 *  - Achieve high throughput by efficiently utilizing available bandwidth.
 *  - Achieve low latency and packet loss rates by keeping queues bounded and
 *    small.
 *  - Share bandwidth with other flows in an approximately fair manner.
 *  - Feed samples to the model estimators to refresh and update the model.

 *
 * 4.3.1.1. Startup Dynamics
 *
 * When a BBR flow starts up, it performs its first (and most rapid) sequential
 * probe/drain process in the Startup and Drain states. Network link bandwidths
 * currently span a range of at least 11 orders of magnitude, from a few bps to
 * hundreds of Gbps. To quickly learn BBR.max_bw, given this huge range to
 * explore, BBR's Startup state does an exponential search of the rate space,
 * doubling the sending rate each round. This finds BBR.max_bw in O(log_2(BDP))
 * round trips.
 * To achieve this rapid probing smoothly, in Startup BBR uses the minimum gain
 * values that will allow the sending rate to double each round: in Startup BBR
 * sets BBR.pacing_gain to BBRStartupPacingGain (2.77) [BBRStartupPacingGain]
 * and BBR.cwnd_gain to BBRDefaultCwndGain (2) [BBRStartupCwndGain].
 * As BBR grows its sending rate rapidly, it obtains higher delivery rate
 * samples, BBR.max_bw increases, and the pacing rate and cwnd both adapt by
 * smoothly growing in proportion. Once the pipe is full, a queue typically
 * forms, but the cwnd_gain bounds any queue to (cwnd_gain - 1) * estimated_BDP,
 * which is approximately (2 - 1) * estimated_BDP = estimated_BDP. The

 * accelerating sending rate has saturated the available per-flow bandwidth
 * ("filled the pipe") by looking for a plateau in the measured rs.delivery_rate.
 * BBR tracks the status of the current full-pipe estimation process in the
 * boolean BBR.full_bw_now, and uses BBR.full_bw_now to exit ProbeBW_UP. BBR
 * records in the boolean BBR.full_bw_reached whether BBR estimates that it has
 * ever fully utilized its available bandwidth (over the lifetime of the
 * connection), and uses BBR.full_bw_reached to decide when to exit Startup and
 * enter Drain.The full pipe estimator works as follows: if BBR counts several
 * (three) non-application-limited rounds where attempts to significantly increase
 * the delivery rate actually result in little increase (less than 25 percent),
 * then it estimates that it has fully utilized the per-flow available bandwidth,
 * and sets both BBR.full_bw_now and BBR.full_bw_reached to true.
