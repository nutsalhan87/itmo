DeviceAtlas Device Detection
----------------------------

In order to add DeviceAtlas Device Detection support, you would need to download
the API source code from https://deviceatlas.com/deviceatlas-haproxy-module.
Once extracted :

    $ make TARGET=<target> USE_DEVICEATLAS=1 DEVICEATLAS_SRC=<path to the API root folder>

Optionally DEVICEATLAS_INC and DEVICEATLAS_LIB may be set to override the path
to the include files and libraries respectively if they're not in the source
directory. Also, in the case the api cache support is not needed and/or a C++ toolchain
 could not be used, DEVICEATLAS_NOCACHE is available.

    $ make TARGET=<target> USE_DEVICEATLAS=1 DEVICEATLAS_SRC=<path to the API root folder> DEVICEATLAS_NOCACHE=1

However, if the API had been installed beforehand, DEVICEATLAS_SRC
can be omitted. Note that the DeviceAtlas C API version supported is from the 3.x
releases series (3.2.1 minimum recommended).

For HAProxy developers who need to verify that their changes didn't accidentally
break the DeviceAtlas code, it is possible to build a dummy library provided in
the addons/deviceatlas/dummy directory and to use it as an alternative for the
full library. This will not provide the full functionalities, it will just allow
haproxy to start with a deviceatlas configuration, which generally is enough to
validate API changes :

    $ make TARGET=<target> USE_DEVICEATLAS=1 DEVICEATLAS_SRC=$PWD/addons/deviceatlas/dummy

These are supported DeviceAtlas directives (see doc/configuration.txt) :
  - deviceatlas-json-file <path to the DeviceAtlas JSON data file>.
  - deviceatlas-log-level <number> (0 to 3, level of information returned by
    the API, 0 by default).
  - deviceatlas-property-separator <character> (character used to separate the
    properties produced by the API, | by default).
  - deviceatlas-cache-size <number> (number of cache entries, 0 by default).

Sample configuration :

    global
	deviceatlas-json-file <path to json file>

    ...
    frontend
	bind *:8881
	default_backend servers

There are two distinct methods available, one which leverages all HTTP headers
and one which uses only a single HTTP header for the detection. The former
method is highly recommended and more accurate. There are several possible use
cases.

# To transmit the DeviceAtlas data downstream to the target application

All HTTP headers via the sample / fetch

    http-request set-header X-DeviceAtlas-Data %[da-csv-fetch(primaryHardwareType,osName,osVersion,browserName,browserVersion,browserRenderingEngine)]

Single HTTP header (e.g. User-Agent) via the converter

    http-request set-header X-DeviceAtlas-Data %[req.fhdr(User-Agent),da-csv-conv(primaryHardwareType,osName,osVersion,browserName,browserVersion,browserRenderingEngine)]

# Mobile content switching with ACL

All HTTP headers

    acl is_mobile da-csv-fetch(mobileDevice) 1

Single HTTP header

    acl device_type_tablet req.fhdr(User-Agent),da-csv-conv(primaryHardwareType) "Tablet"

Note that the JSON download scheduler is now part of the API's package, it is recommended
to read its documentation. Note it needs to be started before HAProxy.
