 * When SC_FL_ABRT_WANTED/SC_FL_EOS is set, it is strictly forbidden for the
 * producer to alter the buffer contents. In this case, the consumer is free to
 * perform a shutdown when it has consumed the last contents, otherwise the
 * session processor will do it anyway. SC_FL_ABRT* are set at the upper layer
 * level (the stream) while SC_FL_EOS is set at the SE layer.
 *
 * The SC_FL_SHUT_WANTED flaga should be set by the session processor when
 * SC_FLABRT_DONE/SC_FL_EOS and CF_AUTO_CLOSE are both set. And it may also be
 * set by the producer when it detects SC_FL_EOS while directly forwarding data to the
 * consumer.
 *
 * The SHUT/ABRT flags work like this :
 *
 *  ABRT_WANTED ABRT_DONE  meaning
 *      0           0      normal case, connection still open and data is being read
 *      1           0      closing : the producer cannot feed data anymore but can close
 *     0/1          1      closed: the producer has closed its input channel.
 *
 *  SHUT_WANTED SHUT_DONE  meaning
 *      0          0      normal case, connection still open and data is being written
 *      1          0      closing: the consumer can send last data and may then close
 *     0/1         1      closed: the consumer has closed its output channel.
 *
 *
 * The ABRT_WANTED flag is mostly used to force the producer to abort when an error is
 * detected on the consumer side.
